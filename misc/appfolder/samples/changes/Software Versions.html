<h1>Software Versions</h1>

<h3>Version 1.4 </h3>
<ol>
<li> There is now a new Time Tab with information about the time that a particular item is expected to occur. This Tab has three fields: Start Time, Duration, and Alert Prior. There is also a default Start Time on the View Tab. Whatever Start Time you enter here (00:00 or midnight, by default) will be assigned to each new To Do Item within that particular data store.
<li> By setting a start time for an item and by setting alert prior to something other than N/A (both fields appearing on the new Time Tab), an alert will be triggerred at the specified time. Your system will beep and a dialog box will come up, reminding you of the item. You may dismiss the box with no change, or request that the alerting item be brought into view.
</ol>
<h3>Version 1.3 </h3>
<ol>
<li> Fixed a bug in logic that checked your registration code. If the first digit after the last dash was a zero, then the registration check would fail.
<li> Can now set a recurrence to happen on the last day of week of a month (in addition to the first, second, third or fourth).
