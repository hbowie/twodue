Display and editing of the Due date have been reworked to make them easier to use. Dates that have not yet been set now appear as &quot;N/A&quot;. The Due Date display on the Item Tab is now a single button labeled with the date. To change the date, click on the button to bring up a dialog that has a full calendar for the month. You may enter a year and month directly, or click on increment/decrement buttons to change them gradually. Click on the desired day of the month to set that. There is also a &quot;Today&quot; button to set the date to the current date, another button to set the date value to a null value or &quot;N/A&quot;, plus a Recur button for recurring dates.
